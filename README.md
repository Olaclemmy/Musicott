Musicott is an application that manages and plays music files. Coded in Java 8 with JavaFX.
Uses [JAudioTagger](https://bitbucket.org/ijabz/jaudiotagger "jAudioTagger") to read and write the metadata,
[Json-io](https://github.com/jdereg/json-io "Json-io") for persistence,
[TestFx](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX "TestFx") for testing, [Guice](https://github.com/google/guice/) for dependency injection and some components from
[ControlsFx](https://bitbucket.org/controlsfx/controlsfx/ "ControlsFx").

* Shows waveform of mp3, wav and m4a files
* Import from Itunes Library xml
* Scrobble on LastFM

### Not yet
* Advanced search feature
* Music library statistics
* Smart playlists

## Download
I had some trouble creating the native packages and even the jar file, since now the project is structured in several modules. I will work on it and I will upload the release packages when I'll achieve this. Running as described as described in the following section is the recommended way.

## How to build and run
To build you need at least Java 8 update 40 and Maven

 1. Clone Musicott at any directory `git clone https://github.com/octaviospain/Musicott.git`
 2. Build with maven at Musicott's root folder (where `pom.xml` is located)  with `mvn package -Dmaven.test.skip=true`
 4. Install this two required jar libraries into the local maven repository executing
 ```
 mvn install:install-file -Dfile=application/lib/TarsosTranscoder-1.2.jar -DgroupId=be.tarsos -DartifactId=transcoder -Dversion=1.2 -Dpackaging=jar
 mvn install:install-file -Dfile=common/lib/iTunesUtilities.jar -DgroupId=com.worldsworstsoftware -DartifactId=itunesutilities -Dversion=1.2 -Dpackaging=jar
 ```
 3. Run with `mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.transgressoft.musicott.MusicottApplication`

## How to contribute

If you want to add a feature or fix a bug in Musicott, you can submit a pull request as follows:

 1. Fork the project
 2. Write the code of the feature with some `javadoc` and the necessary comments
 3. Please don't auto-format the code already written as it would make more difficult to see what was changed
 4. Add some tests! **Doing it in the `tests` branch is preferable**
 5. Commit
 6. Submit a pull request **on the `develop` branch**

## Manual
